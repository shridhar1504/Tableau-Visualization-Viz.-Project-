## Objectives:
  * Identifying the location and magnitude of each earthquake that occured between 1900 - 2013.
  * Finding the correlation between depth and magnitude for occurence of magnitude greater than 7 on Richter scale.
  * Observing the relationships between depth and magnitude of each earthquake.
  * Finding the country or continenet which has highest occurence of earthquake with magnnitude greater than 7 on Richter scale.
## Solutions:
  * By using geological visulaization of all earthquakes, we can identify the magnitudes using bubble sizes in the map. (WorkBook - 1)
  * Plotting scatter plot to get the correlation between Depth and Magnitude of earthquakes. (WorkBook - 2)
  * Plotting scatter plot to observe the relationship between Depth and Magnitude of earthquakes with Magnitude Filter. (WorkBook - 3)
  * With tree map the country with highest occurence of earthquakes can be identified with Year and magnitude as filters. (WorkBook - 4)
  * By using the tree map the 6 countries with high number of mega earthquakes(i.e., Greater than 7 on Richter scale are identfied as mega earthquakes) and with bar chart the 6 countries is visualized to show no. of times earthquakes occured. (WorkBook - 5)
  * The bubble chart is used to show the countries with high no. of earthquakes. (WorkBook - 6)
